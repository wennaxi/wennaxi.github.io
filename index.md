## Welcome to My Homepage!

I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Healthcare Policy and Research](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/) at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), under the joint supervision of [Samprit Banerjee](http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-sab2028) and [Jyotishman Pathak](http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/display/cwid-jyp2001). I completed my PhD in Biostatistics from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) under the supervision of [Catherine (Kate) Calder](https://cacalder.com/). 

At Weill Cornell, I am using insurance claims data to study the healthcare utilization patterns among patients with mental health diagnosis. In addition, I am developing new positive-unlabeled (PU) learning method to improve the accuracy of mental health diagnosis in clinical settings. 

My doctoral dissertation focuses on the statistical analysis of co-location networks, which are a special type of two-mode networks where ties are only defined between the nodes of different modes. In the case of co-location networks, nodes represent individuals and geographic locations and ties indicate that the individual visits the location. I use co-location networks to study routine activity patterns of individuals within an urban setting. The primary objective, in particular, is to detect ecological communities of individuals based on the set of locations where they spend time, instead of their locations of residence. I use two approaches to achieve the goal: 1) latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a well-developed method in text data mining, and 2) hierarchical Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is similar to LDA but can be adapted to make use of sparse finite mixture techniques to automatically determine the number of communities in a co-location network. 

Beyond my dissertation research, I was a Graduate Research Associate (GRA) at Ohio Stateâ€™s Center of Excellence in Regulatory Tobacco Science (OSU-CERTS) from September 2015 to August 2018, where I provided data management and statistical analysis for two ongoing surveys: the Buckeye Teen Health Study (BTHS) and the Tobacco User Adult Cohort (TUAC).
