## Welcome to My Homepage!

My name is Wenna Xi and I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in the [Interdisciplinary Program in Biostatistics](https://biostatprograms.osu.edu/home) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). My advisor is Dr. [Kate Calder](https://cacalder.com/). 

For my PhD's dissertation, I am working on using hierarchical Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify ecological communities and sparse finite mixture models to determine the number of communities in co-location networks.
